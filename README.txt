Hello to whomever will be analyzing my work.

The project "SOLUTION" itself was broken. With that said, I sorted things out. 

Asides from the obivious trip ups (I really liked the missing "."... that kinda frustration makes you remember.)
Anyhoot, the primary issue with the exercise is that @media queries were not functioning sans a <meta>.
That said, I also spruced things up with some min/max's and the like. Enjoy ;-) 


Thanks
